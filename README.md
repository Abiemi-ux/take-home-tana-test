### Question 2: Unique Sums
Counts how many combinations of array elements sum to a target using recursion.

### Question 3: Make Zero
Checks if all elements can be made zero by subtracting previous elements from the end.

### Question 4: First Unique Product
Returns the first unique string in an array by counting occurrences.

### Question 5: Min Distance
Finds the smallest distance between consecutive minimum values in an array.

### Question 6: Top Three Words
Finds the top 3 most frequent words in a sentence and sorts them alphabetically.

### Question 7: Rotate List

## How to Run the Code

1. Compile the Java file:
```
javac QuestionX_Filename.java
```
Replace `QuestionX_Filename.java` with the specific file name, e.g. `Question1_GetLongestString.java`.

2. Run the compiled Java class:
```
java QuestionX_Filename
```
Replace `QuestionX_Filename` with the class name without the `.java` extension, e.g. `Question1_GetLongestString`.

Example:
```
javac Question1_GetLongestString.java
java Question1_GetLongestString
```

Repeat the above steps for each question file you want to run.
